"""
Core plugin base classes used by the simulator.

This module introduces a minimal plugin API so that behaviours such as
agent movement and arena logic can be extended from external modules
without modifying the core code.

The aim is to keep backward compatibility with the original project:
if no plugins are configured, the simulator behaves exactly as before.
